1) Code examples and their purpose

A) process_creation.c (fork)
- Uses fork() to create a child process.
- Child branch (pid == 0): prints its PID.
- Parent branch (pid > 0): prints its PID.
- On failure (pid == -1): prints an error message.

B) Shell process management
- sleep 300 &: starts a 300-second sleep in the background.
- jobs: displays background jobs.
- ps aux | grep sleep: finds the running sleep process and its PID.
- kill <PID>: sends SIGTERM to terminate the process.
- kill -STOP <PID>: pauses the process (SIGSTOP).
- kill -CONT <PID>: resumes the process (SIGCONT).

C) Linker example (file1.c + file2.c)
- file1.c defines hello().
- file2.c declares hello() and calls it in main().
- The linker resolves the external symbol hello and produces a single executable.

D) Loader example (simple_program.c)
- At runtime, the loader maps the executable and its shared libraries into memory.
- ldd simple_program lists the dynamic libraries the binary depends on (e.g., libc, ld-linux).

2) Role of the Linker
- Combines object files into an executable.
- Resolves external references between translation units.
- Arranges code/data sections, applies relocations, and links against libraries.

3) Role of the Loader
- Loads the executable into memory for execution.
- Resolves dynamic symbols and relocations for shared libraries.
- Sets up the process image and transfers control to the entry point.

4) Makefile
- Builds process_creation, output_program, and simple_program.
- Includes run targets and a clean target.

5) README.md
- Provides overview, build/run instructions, shell commands, and license info.

6) License
- MIT License included in LICENSE file.

7) Screenshots
- Capture outputs after make, run targets, and ldd.
- Save them in /screenshots directory.
